My intended goal is to design a visualization that shows the difference in male and female population from 1990 to 2000.By focusing on
the difference between male and female, I downplayed the importance of average age between sex's. Because my primary focus is sex, I summed
up the total population for male and female's, as their age is not a target feature. After I summed up the total population for each sex,
I could then plot the total population for each sex for 1990 and 2000. This makes it very easy for readers to understand that the female
population in the United States is higher than males. I think that my scale is appropriate given that readers are still able to discern
the difference in populations between males and females easily. I think that the well written labels play the biggest role in the effective communication
of this visualization.
